A simple full stacks web application that will host my Wine Catalog.
Using python, SQLAlchemy and ORM.

Implements simple CRUD operations on a minimal database, designed to store about a 100 wines.

Will attempt to move on to allow users to create accounts and store their own wine catalogs, and link simplar wines.
