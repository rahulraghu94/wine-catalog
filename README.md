A simple full stacks web application that will host my Wine Catalog.
Using Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy. The application was a way to learn
the intricacies of full stack web development, to integrate databases, to 
learn a framework and to integrate front-end design.

I also learnt that I have no scope for front end design and that i should stay 
away from it. Though the Material UI might look good, it isn't. I could use
a ton of help with it!

Implements simple CRUD operations on a minimal database, designed to 
store about a 100 wines, and search for them. 

Will attempt to move on to allow users to create accounts and store 
their own wine catalogs, and link simplar wines.
